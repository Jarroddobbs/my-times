                  <span>Mother of Three Buys Tuna Steak at Phish Concert. Leaves, "Feeling Funny." </span>
       </div>
       <div class="narrative">
                  <p>MONUMENT VALLEY, AZ - It was supposed to be a fun night out for mother of three, Janet Johnson. She had purchased tickets for the Phish Concert last Saturday evening, and attended with two friends. The venue of the concert was a local eatery in the downtown area which also hosts live music on the weekends. Janet ordered the tuna steak which she claims was recommended to her by her waiter.  While the taste of the tuna steak left something to be desired, Janet says it didn't raise any red flags to alert her that something may not be right with the delicacy. It wasn't until the band was into their second set that Janet realised something 'fishy' was going on.</p>
                  <p>"I felt my stomach start to turn, and had to run to the restroom immediately. My friends and I left shortly afterwards," says Janet about the incident.</p>
                  <p>While Janet seems to have made a full recovery, she wants the resturaunt to take a closer look at the food they are serving their customers. We contacted the eatery in hopes of a statement, but our calls have not been returned.</p>
                  <p>Janet's friends are both vegan, so they were not affected by the 'fishy' food.</p>

              <h2>FBI Finds Action Star Guilty of False Advertising </h2>
         </div>
              <p class="narrative">WASHINGTON DC- We've been seeing actors do more and more of their own stunts lately. In fact, out of work stunt doubles are becoming quite a drain on our welfare system. However, what stunts are just going too far? In Peter Prescot's latest movie, "Moonwalk to Space," he actually creates special boots to 'walk' to the moon! Sounds like a stunt, but Prescot maintains that he really does have the skill to walk through space. After hearing this claim, Prescot was approached by the FBI who was in need of this kind of technology and skill. Prescot has been detained for, "getting the FBI's hopes up."</p>

                <span>Cats in Control-Is It a Thing? </span>
              </div>
          <div class="narrative">
               <p>BROOKLYN, NY- If you are a cat owner, you may have noticed that they can be very demanding. But just how in control are they? Scientists say that we are more subserviant to our feline friends than we might like to think.</p>
               <p>"A cat's meow actually contains high frequency vibrations that affect our brains in ways otherwise unknown," says Dr. Science. "In fact, those vibrations may trigger a need in us to fulfill whatever the cat is asking for."</p>
               <p>If you think that sounds silly, just ask a cat owner.</p>
               <p>"I definitely will jump at the sound of Fluffy's meows," says Shirley. "It's like something comes over me. I definitley always know what she wants, even if she can't say it to me in English. It's like we have a special connection."
                 </p>
               <p>Scienctists are still studying this phenomenon, but one thing is for sure: we'll be paying more attention to what our cats are asking from us. Right now it's cat food, but could world domination be next?</p>
